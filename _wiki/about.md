# About Chrysalis

Chrysalis is a project written for CRYENGINE 5 that aims to provide the base for Action RPG style games.

The initial goal is to be capable of supporting "Walking Simulator" exploration games. Over time we will add networking and features typical of RPG games.

The core code is all written in C++11.
