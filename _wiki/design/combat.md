# Combat

The fight style and animations will be based on the weapon(s) currently in use. Weapons will determine the range at which you can attack and hit the opponent. They also determine if you can block and the animations for such. Larger weapons might optionally prevent you from dodging or rolling.

The weapons are broken down into categories which would support similar fight styles. Note: styles will generally be the western
variants. Eastern styles might be able to be added.

Given the indie nature of this project I expect to start with only the basic weapons i.e. knife, sword, axe, mace but with an eye to adding the more interesting ones over time.
