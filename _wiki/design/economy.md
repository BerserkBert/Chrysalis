# Economy

The economy needs to run on a zero sum game in order to prevent inflation from destroying the value of everything. If end game players are swimming in millions of gold and noobs have 12 copper it creates a vast gulf between the two players. End gamers craft items and sell them on the AH at incredibly high prices compared to what a noob can afford, thus creating a huge barrier to entry.

For every type of item that can be introduced to the game you need a way to later remove it from the game. Some ideas:

-   Gold – crafting, char customisation, dye, guild taxes, guild bribes officials for favors or open up services in territories...
-   Trash items – just don't fucking drop them
-   Mats – turned into items or sold to vendors for fuck all
-   Recipes – once learnt they are destroyed
-   Gems / enhancement items – socket, random destruction on death – wipes will slowly leave you with unenhanced gear unless you carry spares
-   Consumables – consumed or vended for pittance
-   Items – break them down for lower lvl materials back – mats can be polished to higher lvl mats by destroying a bunch of them – effectively destroy – exact process might vary based on the mat.

You should be able to constantly recycle, re-use and repurpose existing mats and items – but always at a loss to bleed them out the system
