# Events

Events refer to scripted events that can occur on the realm / zones. A goal is to make it possible for any player / faction to craft their own events.

(Side thought, this might be a great way to drain revenue from the economy e.g. an event that rewards a sword for participation would have to have x number of those swords crafted by the faction running the event. Rich guilds would hold events, causing capital to flow down to other players who attend the event)

The character (account) / faction which holds the event is responsible for funding the rewards for people who participate in the event. Consider how best to manage this to prevent factions going broke from hosting events or it being too expensive for smaller factions to run their own. It might be possible to compromise and simply allow them to provide a basic amount of the goods, and anything above that is gratis - courtesy of the realm. Checks need to be in place to prevent inflation, while maintaining a balance that encourages people to participate - both in other people's events and in making their own.

Events should be able to run semi-scripted i.e. each phase of the script is kicked off by hand by a player. Additionally, they need to be able to automatically advance, reset themselves, sleep, and restart according to a schedule or based on another event.

A measure of success is to have an event that people want to come and experience, that is balanced in nature, well scripted and interactive.

Example:

A large faction owns a cave where a family of trolls live. This enables them to start an event every few days where the trolls are controlled by one or more of their players and advance on nearby towns wreaking havoc. Players would be notified of the event and given the chance to defend the town and kill the trolls. Trolls would be like hero units, very powerful. It would be prudent to limit event durations and scope (zone / region) to prevent abuse (within reason).

Events need not be all about combat. You could organise a faire, a fishing contest, or a poetry reading. XP could be awarded for excellent roleplay or event management. Beware of the "sister guild", "fight clubbing" and "shadow siege" issues that can arise from this.

I want to reward participation in the world, to make it as valid a game-play style any other. These people make great worlds, they need to feel rewarded and loved.

## Roleplay / Story Events

One event type would be a roleplay event where players are looking to further the lore and history of the server, or just breathe a little life into the place.

Like any other event this could reward items, xp, etc. It's story led and interactive, so it might need some sort of "most valued player" method of handing out rewards. Those caught abusing it would be banned.
