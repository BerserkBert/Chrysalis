# Features

Take the best from the ones out there and add in my own.

## My Ideas

Players select abilities from ones they have learnt and place it on their ability bar – which is a bar with 4 states – showing 8 abilities in each state. A player can switch between states at will, choosing to be in a tank / heal / dps / support state. Flipping states costs one GCD.

(all figures subject to sanity checks)

=== Tank state ===

* 66% less dmg taken, other stats boosted to become more tanky. 33% less dps and 33% less healing abilities.

=== DPS state – neutral ===

* Neutral.

=== Healing state ===

* 33% more damage taken, 66% more healing ability, 33% less dps

=== Support ===
* 33% less dps, 33% less heals (should provide enough dps boost to justify having them and more, also provide useful CC and the like)

*Mobs will not be tankable in general. They will not follow standard aggro, some might switch on healer hate, others might hate getting a DoT landed on them. The idea is that aggro should switch about forcing everyone to take turns tanking and possibly healing or supporting. Perhaps being damaged from behind pisses some of them off ^^

When a mob aggros it will move to attack that player – the player should normally switch to the tank state and state using damage reduction abilities. Kiting might also be possible, but the general case is we want to shake things up a bit.

The ability wheel from TSW is a great idea, maybe with some modifications to it and the content. Horizontal progression should be the key word of this product. Abilities will be sorted by weapons and each will have a flag to say if it can be slotted into tank / heal / etc state. Might be nice to grade the abilities by a measure of strength, like they allow only one elite e.g. 3 minor, 3 major, 2 elite (will need proof of concept)

Gear will be like TSW as well but perhaps one change to make it head / major / minor / feet – and you can slot any item as long as it matches the slot type. Naming gear becomes a bit more tricky but it gives people a little more leverage to get a drop that fills that final slot.

Combat should be Tera like, with white circles from TSW. Should have collision detection. Bosses should be heavily scripted, there should be BAMs, world bosses, and an option to play as a 5 man group through all content set to elite like in AoC (elite mode). The end game should start right at the start. I would like to be able to have a steady five man group that faces challenging content all the way through – whether this is instances, BAMs, world bosses, mini bosses or packs of trash.

Gear inflation and stat inflation are the enemy of these sorts of games. Find a way to avoid giving them more and more powerful gear as a reward every hour. Gear should last a very long time in game, not be replaced constantly. If you don't allow these to inflate then all content becomes reusable.

Include rifts and public quests.

## GM controlled events


## Player housing


## Guild housing

## Sandpit features

World PVP catered to – perhaps have ppl flag and move them to a shadow zone for pvp – these could be set up to cater to groups of 5 / 10 / 20. Every zone in the game could be a PVP battleground.

Siege and zone control. Capture of nodes to control an area. Build forts if you control the whole zone.

Groups size is generally six players. This is to accommodate standard play option of

1 x tank, 1 x healer, 1 x support, 3 x dps
2 x tank, 1 x healer, 1 x control, 1 x support, 2 x dps
2 x tank, 2 x healer, 2 x dps
etc

## Longevity

I've been wondering why I stuck around in WoW classic for so long given it's lack of features compared to new products and how crappy WoW is as a rule. It comes down to a few things:

=== Community ===

We had a really great guild and great outside guilds to play with
role playing helping each other – a lot of time was spent helping others achieve their goals too

Sandbox features could really help with this issue. Having guilds own sections of land, needing them to defend it and improve it. Gardens for players, etc.

## Test Harness

* Build a test game with the most basic features you can that allows you to start testing these ideas.
* Start with one room with nothing in it but decorations.
* Provide portals to other places, including armoury, tutorial, etc.
* Create a single room boss fight to begin getting a feeling for how things can work.
* Create a small area with packs of mobs and usual trash for single player testing.
* Provide FATE for the players to get started quickly.

## HUD / UI

Try to show all the usual HUD / UI info in the game window instead. Gets their eyes on the mobs they are fighting and the people they are healing / buffing.

Move the usual health bars and the like to circles around the feet of the mob similar to AoC. Inner ring shows health either as a segment or pie fractions of a segment (like a strip of warning tape around the ring).
Healing received rings shown like in AoC – some way to show shields too
