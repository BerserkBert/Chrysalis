# Goals

## Excellent User Experience

Provide an excellent user experience at every level.

## Expansion 

Provide a base on which we can expand out and users can modify with relative ease. Make use of the mod community.

## Push the Envelope

Position the end products to push the boundaries in terms of hardware, graphics, and user experience.

## Develop Good People Into Great People

Cross skill, up-skill, etc.

## Leisure, Not A Second Job

The game should never feel like a second job to the player. It must enhance their life, not drain it.

## Bring Players and Friends Together

Strive to ensure players are not separated by arbitrary barriers to play.
