## Quality

Some items will have a quality value, and a subset of those items will be able to have their quality improved via crafting or quests.

-   Trash (grey)
-   Average(white)
-   Above Average (green)
-   Rare (blue)
-   Epic (purple)
-   Legendary (Orange)
-   Artifact (Yellow)

Item drops and rewards will typically be of average quality.

Rather than placing stats on each item, quality should provide an overall boost. Individual preferences can be applied through one or more of the trades e.g. enchantments

Item graphics will be independent of the item quality to a reasonable degree. For example, a sword with an attractive model might drop but be of trash quality. The player has the choice of slowly upgrading that item until it is of epic quality.

Legendary and artifact quality items will only ever be placed by the system. An example might be on a given server if a character has achieved a series of great victories then their favorite sword might be upgraded by a GM to legendary quality and given a name.

Players should have a sense of pride in their equipment. Gear should be something that has sentimental value and need not be tossed aside simply because it is made redundant in a new expansion.
