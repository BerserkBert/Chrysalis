# Missions

Missions are multi-step quest chains that provide guided game-play for the players. They are typically used to direct players to move between areas, to explore, gather and most frequently - kill 10 rats.

I would like the mission system to allow any player the ability to create and share missions with all the other players. They should be able to provide rewards, including but not limited to:

-   faction
-   XP
-   items
-   currency
-   skill category
-   skill
-   skill point

With great power comes the need for great moderation abilities. Missions will need to run through a co-operative CMS style process to help prevent people creating ones that hand out a legendary weapon and a full set of legendary armour for talking to an NPC.

Missions should be able to be forked, for use by other players who can then make their own custom version of the mission. In fact, initially, modifications of template missions might be the only way players can introduce new missions.

For this to work the missions would need:

-   a publication system
-   a weighting for difficulty and thus possible rewards
-   limitations on items / skills that are possible as rewards e.g. only items of medium quality, 5-10 gold, 100-150 XP

Missions should be able to invoke interactive sequences, dialogue, start events, etc.

We could provide a pack of standard missions to get each realm started. They could then create missions based on those templates but unique to their own realm. Admins should be able to create whole new forms of missions and set permissions for who can create templated versions of those.

Missions and events are likely to have a reasonable degree of crossover.
