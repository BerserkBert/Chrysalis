# Quest Types

The system will support the ability for any user to create their own quests, including appropriate rewards for the
quest recipient. These rewards will be funded by the quest giver, coming out of an account kept for this purpose. It stands
to reason that you will want to get some funds behind you before you decide to start handing out quests.

Owning one or more NPCs in the game who can hand out quests and rewards should be a status symbol as well as something to aspire towards.

In order to control quality we will need to set limits on most things as well as use a system of peer review.

# The Basic Quest Types

Quests can generally be broken down in general categories based on their completion goals. Many of these types have not changed since the earliest days of computer gaming.

A quest might consist of one or more of these types, chain them together as tasks for an overall mission, or be completely original and scripted.

## Location Based Quests

The simplest form of quests are location based quests. These simply redirect the player from one location to another with a few optional tasks.

### Locate

You will need to locate an individual, item, or map location. These are often already marked on your map making it significantly easier to find them.

### Delivery (aka Fedex)

You are expected to deliver something to an NPC. This will usually be some form of item or perhaps a message.

### Interact

In this variant you are expected to move to the location(s) and interact with either objects or NPCs. They will generally trigger some response, potentially opening doors, delivering a cinematic, or handing out rewards or the next task in a chain.

## Killing

### Kill X of Y

The classic version of this quest is to kill 10 rats and it is often the very first quest you will encounter. This quest type is used as a filler or pacing mechanism and to ensure you engage in some combat at varying intervals.

### Kill Named Y

This is usually a quest that is handed out after you have killed an entire village of creatures already. This often includes the actual target of this quest - possibly multiple times.

In this quest type you are generally sent to locate an NPC who is powerful enough to have a name. They are often an elite NPC or tougher than their monster type. You will need to clear a path back into the same place you just genocided on the previous quest(s) and kill the named creature(s). These quests usually come at the end of a chain and provide a way for the developer to re-use the content several times with little cost.

### Kill X of Y and Collect I of J

This is a mixture of two hated quest mechanics and has the potential to frustrate and bore the player. That said, it's still a staple of every RPG I've ever played.

In this variant you need to kill X number of Y creatures. Each creature has a chance to drop 1 or more items, typically a body part or an item they might be expected to be carrying. Once you have collected I items of type J the quest is completed.

What makes this quest type so irritating is quest designers who place ridiculous drop rates on the quest mobs. I'll give two examples that stand out in my head clearly from having completed their painful ritual on several occasions.

Example 1: Zhevra Hooves

http://www.wowhead.com/quest=845/the-zhevra

Zhevras are a fairly weak creature which are located all over the barrens in small numbers. While quick to kill, they are sparse in numbers and even though they each have four hooves you will only get s drop of a single hoof perhaps one in ten times. Given you only need four hooves it should only take one kill to complete this quest but due to terrible drop rates you are often an agent of the Zhevra apocalypse, slaughtering 50+ to complete the quest.

Example 2: Hercular's Rod

In this quest chain you are eventually called to enter a cave filled with yeti's. They spawn fast, patrol, and are likely to swarm you if you don't know your aggro radius. You need to kill yeti until the Rod of Hercular drops, and it has a drop rate of about 1% so you will be killing them by the hundreds. Worse still, the cave is filled with many other players are competing to slaughter the yeti's in the hope of completing the same mission. It's total chaos on a pvp server where you need to not only avoid being stomped by the yeti's, compete with your own faction members to tag the kills, but also try not to get ganked by swarms of high level griefers who go there specifically to cause you grief.

Keeping the drop rates high will limit frustration on these quest types.

## Collection

### Collect X of Y

The player is tasked with moving to a location and collecting objects, generally by interacting with them. This might be picking berries, picking up wreckage off the ground, ripping out comms units from towers or another WoW classic...sifting through scat for berries.

## Escort

In an escort quest you will be expected to locate an NPC and escort them safely along a predetermined path to their destination. At certain points groups of mobs will tend to spawn and you will need to fight them off - protecting the NPC(s). Failure to do so will result in a quest failure.

What makes these so frustrating is he NPCs are often suicidally stupid and will rush into the middle of packs of elite mobs - one after another. You rarely get time to rest or restore health and resources. The NPCs have a terrible habit of getting stuck on trees and buildings and will reset if they do. If you can't kill fast enough they will leave you behind and once again reset.

## Defense

Defend an NPC, item or place for a fixed period of time against waves of attackers. These kinds of quests often guarantee that players are forced into one location for the entire time until the quest is complete; it also sees them get very aggravated when they fail the mission on the last wave.

## Crafting

### Craft Skills

In order to complete the mission something needs to be crafted by the player (or developed by some kind of craft skill). Every now and again the mission designers remember there are other systems in their MMO outside of combat and movement and drop one of these in.

### Manufacture

In this quest type you are expected to craft one or more of an item. Often you will need to craft 10 or more of these items leading to a huge glut of them on the auction house and the situation where the materials are worth far more than the items themselves. These quest types completely devalue the craft skills.

These quests are often a way to create demand for raw materials, forcing people to spend large amounts of their time scrounging around for copper / leather instead of enjoying engaging gameplay.

### Upgrade or Repair

Far more rare is the quest that looks to upgrade, repair or even modify a crafted item using your crafting skills. This quest type will expect you to gather certain resources, including the focus item, and then use your existing crafting skills to repair / upgrade the item.

## PVP

These quests range from dailies which are focused on achieving various goals in the battlegrounds to ones that play out within the game world itself. What they have in common is they will flag you for PVP, even on servers where you are usally able to move about unflagged. Rewards will tend to be PVP focused.

## Achievement

The quest is to reach a certain achievement, such as a particular level or craft skill rank or even earn a particular achievement before you can continue. Usually this is used as a gating mechanism - the contact won't even talk to you before you reach this particular achievement - but sometimes the quest itself states what achievement you have to get to before continuing.

## Vehicle

With the release of The Burning Crusade, Blizzard started to push out vehicle based quests.

### Bombing Run

A bombing run quest is one where you are vehicle mounted on a rail and you will need to use your vehicle abilities to target and bomb creatures underneath your flight path. Woe to you if you miss the objective by even one creature - you will need to ride that rail again - doubling the time to complete this quest.

### Tanks, Catapults and Other Machinery

In this variant of the bombing run you have control over the movement of the vehicle. You will still use vehicle controls to smite a plethora of enemies.

Some variations will have you launch bombs at an area or target until you destroy it.

### Horse Race

This quest sees you mounting a horse, motor bike, or other racing vehicle equivalent. You will race around a track or path and either try to beat a timer or other NPC racers.

## Timed

Timed quests are a combination of any other quest types, along with a time limit in which to complete the objectives.

## Class Specific

The class specific quests will be restricted to players of a given class and usually revolve around learning new skills or gaining access to some class specific item e.g. the warlock quest, paladin resurrection quest and the paladin mount quest.

An excellent example of these quests was the epic class quests for hunters in WoW. These had you travel all over the world, fighting extremely difficult trick boss fights and collecting epic raid quality drops. Any hunter who could complete these epic tasks was rewarded with the epic hunter's bow and quiver which made them stand out visually from the ones who hadn't or couldn't.

Sadly, this did lead to many hunters cheating since they couldn't complete the combat sections. They would get a friend to log onto their account for them to complete it. Some would buy a spot on a raid in order to collect the rare drop for that week.

Another example is the Gatekeeper boss fight fight in The Secret World which all players must complete it they want to enter the epic versions of the dungeons.

In this fight you were tested on your ability to make a good build, then use it for ranged and melee combat against a difficult scripted boss. Those who couldn't avoid 'standing in the fire' were unable to pass this gate keeping mechanism.

## Training

Training quests are exposition based events designed to help you learn your character, weapons, combat, or a variety of other things. You can expect them to involved cinematics, followed by you correctly exercising one or more skills needed in game.

The Secret World had an excellent training area within the game that allowed you to not only test new skills out without cost, but also test your weapons and builds.

SWTOR had quite reasonable introduction / training quests for each class.

## Professions

* Profession specific e.g. fishing, tailoring, cooking

## Lore

Lore quests seek to provide large sections of lore to the player.

## Raid / Dungeon / World Boss

These are typically repeatable quests involving killing the named boss. In some cases there are single shot quests for these kills or perhaps a drop from the boss that allow progress in some epic questline.

== Fully Scripted == 

A fully scripted quest is one which has specifically scripted code or is otherwise completely unique.

## Legendary / Epic

Not so much a quest type but more a measure of how difficult to complete these quests are.

Legendary quests will usually take entire guilds to complete.

## Public

These bear a lot of similarity to epic quests but are open to the whole server and tend to take massive amounts of time, effort or resources to complete.

Examples might include building walls around a town, building a town, defeating a world boss invasion or defeating rifts.

# Uncommon Quest Types

Most quest types are heavily repeated but a few are standouts from the crowd.

## Argent Tournament

These quests involved playing several mini-games, for example, mounted combat with a lance.

# Quest Chains vs Missions with Tasks

In many ways the term quest is used loosely here to refer to either a single quest with a single objective or a chain of quests, each with simple or single objectives. This is a result of questing having it's origins in fantasy based games.

The nomenclature we will use to refer to quests within Shattered Screens is 'mission'. A mission will consist of one or more tasks, each of which will generally be one of the common quest types - now referred to as 'task type'. Missions will be able to be chained, repeatable or only available to characters who meet given requirements.

# Quest Rewards

Rewards must be in line with the difficulty and effort required to complete a given mission. Rewards should be specific to the player to avoid filling the auction house with low quality items which are only useful for melting down.

Rewards need to be relevant.
