# Raw Ideas

A loose collection of ideas that may form a part of the system. Toss them in here, we kick them around a bit, and see what sticks.

# Money / Resources

*   Zero sum game
*   avoid inflation
*   try not to let founders be 1%'ers

# Federate

*   Federate all aspects of the system
*   Allow participation on every level
*   *   player
*   *   team
*   *   re-packer

# Zones

*   Top Drawer
*   Sock Drawer, The
*   Developer Island
*   Developer (Nickname) - one for each of us
*   Zones may range in size from 128 x 128 up to 4k x 4k
*   *   128 is very personal place for newbs
*   *   512 is good for instance
*   *   1k for devs
*   *   2k for groups / guilds
*   *   4k top drawer
*   Zone types
*   *   Resource
*   *   Story Telling
*   *   Social
*   *   Dungeon
*   *   Raid
*   *   Personal

Spin up the zones as needed. Provide sharding.

The creator of the zone is able to populate it with freely available content. Some will be available for free usage, and other items might require the zone be monetised or federated in order to utilise them. Check the [[Team:Project:Monetise|monetise]] section for further details.

Use group permissions to only allow devs into these. Same for creating circles of friends / guilds / etc who can enter.

# Miscellaneous

*   re-organise folders
*   spreadsheet to cost out value of all things
*   Layer file to import that shows what is traversable, death to fall down, AI accessible, etc. Can be simply slope based. Gives an idea of dungeon flow in an open dungeon.
*   Spinning tables for objects
*   PVE/PVP/FFA - only during set hours for some zones ?
*   Could it be fun for GM's / community players to take control of a small herd or village and go on a rampage or attack an outlying town in an unscripted event?

# Settings

The system will allow players to enjoy a range of content based in different settings. Players may freely cross over the boundaries between these settings, along with their gear, so long as both meet the requirements and permissions of the new setting.

Each major type of setting will have it's own .pak file of content allowing players to create, share, re-purpose / re-mix.

The major settings that will be planned for from inception are the most common settings of fiction.

*   Asian (Japanese / Chinese / Korean)
*   Base
*   Fantasy (Low / High)
*   Future (Near / Far)
*   Ice Age
*   Modern
*   Period
*   Steampunk
*   Stone Age
*   Western

Content that can be placed into any of these settings will be gathered up and released as part of regular updates.

Team content specific to their own projects will be handled in private .pak files.

# Build First

Certain content meets the criteria of being both fairly easy to construct and frequently used, making it a good candidate for building prior to everything else. Good examples of this include:

*   A portal for each major world type (stargate / henges). One form of portal would have a single set destination, while another would bring up the lobby
*   Boat for trips to other islands
*   Copyright free posters used for decorating homes in a modern setting.

# Fairy Tale Time

Make an NPC that can over the course of nights read classic copyright free versions of faerie tales to a group of children around her feet. There should be room for people to sit around and listen and a few NPCs might be expected there at any given time.

*   Inspiration - [http://listverse.com/2013/02/13/10-disney-movies-with-horrific-origins/](http://listverse.com/2013/02/13/10-disney-movies-with-horrific-origins/)
*   Grisly awful old stories :D

# Holidays

Rather than celebrate the usual modern holidays we will celebrate the ones on which they are all based. These are typically Sun, Moon and harvest related. For example:

*   Saturnalia
*   Ä’ostre
*   Samhain / All Hallows Eve
*   Solstices
*   *   Winter
*   *   Midsummer
*   *   Spring
*   *   Autumn
*   Cycles of the sun, moon, seasons, birth, death, harvest, sowing

# Dungeons

*   Typical is 4 main bosses and 1 bonus boss (hard!). Low amounts of trash.
*   512 x 512 seems a good size for outside ones.
*   You can run any dungeon with any group at any time for any cost.
*   PVP rewards are on par with PVE rewards, but look different.

# Manifest

All files need some way to be tied back to an ID for shopping purposes. A 25 digit product code might cover this well but unless it is in the file name will likely get lost / disconnected. File names with those codes in will suck big time. A checksum code of sufficient length might do the job. Place the results into Manifest.xml for each deployment. Upload the manifest to the shopping site to enable sale of the objects / etc.

SHA-256 is a good candidate.

# PVE is PVP

A PVE boss should work much like a PVP player. Same resists, hits, etc... PVE trash pulls should not need 20 sec long CC to achieve...should be do-able with same CC level as a boss or PVP target - typically around 2-3 secs. Cooldowns will apply. No stunlocks.

Dungeon running should feel fluid, well paced.

# Paced Content and Non-continuous Story-telling

Toy with the idea of paced content. That is content that is delivered to the client(s) at a set pace such as once a week. By doing this we can keep many of the players in lock-step in terms of what zones they are running, and the storyline arc. It can be just a small parcel of content, and should be completely optional in case people miss that weeks - and preferably all re-playable either via a new install of a server or other means.

Could it be provided in the form of a long running instance / raid? Each team / guild can have their own shard / instance and each member can take on one of the roles provided in the place. Roles might be for example, the leader, a medic, love interest, side story team, the antagonist, a thief. Players might need to have some personality traits that allow them to play that particular role e.g the antagonist might require low loyalty and high ambition / greed in order to ensure they would betray the group at a given point in the story.

To make that possible each character will need to have a kind of personality traits monitor. They can set their traits initially, which might be able to be pushed one way or another by in game actions e.g.

Socks

*   Leadership
*   Empathy
*   Compassion
*   Decisiveness
*   Karma (excellent)
*   Cheeky (high)
*   Funny (high)
*   *   Dour (low on her)

Use the good old 3 x decision wheel to choose which actions to take in story e.g. SWTOR. All actions can possibly push traits in one direction or another e.g.

Kill the prisoner:

*   Out of necessity - leadership+, karma-, compassion-
*   For profit - Greed++, Karma--
*   For kicks - loyalty-, loyalty to others-, leadership+/-, karma--, compassion--

# Flashback / non-continuous story-telling

Allow the game to move ALL of the players from the main map to shards running in different times / perspective. We can use this to kick the game of in the spaceship, then perhaps once they are setting up camp they learn more from the traitor Preek. Each char is switched to their analogue in the human world for the week to explore some of that back-story. Roles according to their char once again - acting roles from my tank diving story. In fact, a flash forward to that later as a mid-point of the time periods, worlds, crossover, would be cool.

This has potential as a fairly unique game feature but might cause some players to sulk that they can't just go farm wolves for crafting mats.

# Ticketing / Session System for Premium Content

There needs to be a wide range of options to suit all the sorts of players. Initial support should be given towards:

*   Gold / Silver / Copper / Tin - grading of the content for quality, loot, etc - most likely a crowd sourced figure. This might determine the sort of ticket for entry and therefore it's price.
*   Tickets can expire after a reasonable period to remove cruft and prevent hoarding / gaming the market.
*   Complete access for 24 hours / 48 hours / 1 week / 2 week / 4 week
*   *   After this period the instance is closed down and removed from the server.
*   Single entry, revoked on completion of the last boss. For fun, last boss might drop an item or change a condition that makes bonus boss far easier to take down. This ticket should be a bit cheaper than a day pass - or maybe it's not actually a great idea.
*   Pricing scheme is based on G/S/C/T like a 4 star hotel rating, and then rated according to community feedback on it's quality. Beware, community may underrate all dungeons just to make it cheaper - so perhaps just set the price and have this display as useful too to gauge value.
*   Tickets can be bought in books.
*   A book might for instance have 7 (6 + 1 spare) day passes for a gold rated dungeon. Tickets in books can be ripped out and handed to friends or traded like any other item of value.
*   The book and each tickets hold the session key for the dungeon. No trading of this should be permitted after it is used. Maybe. Need way to ensure we can replace lost players, but avoid the trick of using a PUG to get to a certain boss and then booting them out.
*   You can save your ticket stub in lieu of an achievement and place it in a scrapbook in game. These would be valid on first time boss kills, record times, full clear, etc.
*   Should a party leader be able to revoke someone's ticket to kick them out and replace them? Need a fair way that handles kicking of douches / afkers vs mostly guild run with silent kick just before boss kill. Must avoid WoW PUG woes.
*   A guild can buy a ticket to access a raid level instance for x amount of time. This might not even be a typical dungeon, it might be a storytelling instance, pvp zone?, resource area.

# Raid / Dungeon /Zone state

*   Save the total state of each instance at periods.
*   Save state if servers need to come down.
*   When servers spin up, they load only what they need to start the game
*   Spin up a new server for each instance that players wish to enter.
*   Spin it down after x amount of inactivity
*   Spin it down when the tickets that opened it all expire

## Example State

*   The Isle of Dread
*   *   InstanceID: ABABA847339CD834
*   *   *   BossA: Alive / Dead
*   *   *   BossB: Alive / Dead
*   *   *   BossC: Alive / Dead
*   *   *   BossD: Alive / Dead
*   *   *   BossE: Alive / Dead
*   *   *   BossF: Alive / Dead

Don't fuss over trash packs unless it becomes obvious they are farming them by spinning it up clearing to the first boss, then spinning it down. Trash shouldn't have too much of worth that is reasonably farmable or they shouldn't be able to be farmed at all.

*   FirstDrawbridge: Raised / Lowered / Destroyed
*   Completed: True / False
*   Completion Time: xx/xx/xxxx xx:xx xx
*   EndBossChest: Looted (also marked with who can actually loot it and what is in there)

A dungeon spins up, checks it's states and populates itself accordingly.

# Authentication / Authorisation

*   Create a unique sessionID for every federation and possibly also for the realms. User can call a web API to get one valid for a federation prior to logging into a zone / realm there. This can provide insulation against the server operator grabbing session keys and running wild on your account.
*   The most critical actions should require your private session key. Actions the server takes on your behalf should be done with a key you provide them.
*   That key could time out after a time period and only be renewable if you know the user private session key. This could limit hi-jacking to a short time period and stop them keeping hijacked accounts permanently logged in.

# Cloud Storage

*   Accounts
*   *   AccountID
*   *   AccountName
*   *   Nick (to allow sharing without handing out login key)

*Characters

*   *   CharacterID
*   *   CharacterName
*   *   Sex
*   *   Race
*   *   Birthdate?
*   *   State (data)
*   *   *   Health
*   *   *   Mana / whatever
*   *   *   Buffs
*   *   *   Debuffs
*   *   *   Location (map, co-ords)
*   *   *   Stance
*   *   *   Walk / Swim / Run / Mounted
*   *   *   Gear / Chi / Ki
*   *   *   *   Head

# XBOX Kinect

*   Allow full integration into the game runtime.
*   Allow player to use it to totally control their avatar in real-time. Great for role-play sessions giving the player the ability to use unique actions and animations.
*   Possibly use the microphone for speech. Role-players wouldn't typically use it, but if hooked to a voice recognition and control system it could be great for gesture and voice actions e.g. RPing in a tavern you point to a chair and say 'avatar sit' - and your avatar walks to the chair and sits in it (with 'use' command). You might be able to switch back and forth from custom animations to canned ones somewhat seamlessly e.g. you control for a bit, then set them to idle for a few mins to bio, come back and interact with a customer at your stall to make a sale, etc.
*   Use cases - Kinect is on their desk and it controls the top half of their body. Full body control with them standing at a distance and using simple voice control if possible.

# Cinematics

Cinematic scenes will be crucial to the game-play. They should integrate seamlessly and provide a rich experience for the end player. If possible it would be good to make some adjustments to the visuals prior to running the cinematics (note: this does not apply to short ones where control is taken briefly from the player).

Cinematic mode should provide:

*   Wide screen - black bars in 16:9 - we should be able to use ratios that are common in cinema
*   Remove the HUD
*   Beautiful detail level for your character, effects, party chars and any NPCs
*   FoV + Depth of Field, dynamic, affected by where you are looking - will open up when you stare out at the scenery, closer for in close combat.
*   this mode is meant for small party play or solo play and beautiful snapshots / videos / machinima
*   It's own range of video settings separate to main ones

# Video Settings

Video settings will be available as profiles that allow you to fully tweak each aspect of the video to your own preference. Additionally, they will be aware of when you enter into such conditions as PVP BG / Cinematic / Raid / Normal Game-play. The system will be able to switch to the profile you have set for each of these as appropriate. For instance, entering a battleground would switch to the PVP BG set.

You will also be able to switch them at will.

# The Green Man

A system that allows us to grow trees, bushes, shrubs, herbs, and other plants. Plant growth is dynamic and real-time.

*   Store the location of all the plants in an XML file associated with each level.
*   Save / load the XML (in a .PAK) as needed
*   On timer ticks update the state of the plants in the world
*   *   Age them
*   *   Grow them and add branches if needed
*   *   Change the seasonal colours / leaves
*   *   Activate / deactivate particle effects for leaves falling / pollen
*   *   Open up flowers according to the sun e.g. close at night, open in morning till evening
*   *   Animations for trees to hold various stages of the plants growth cycle. Perhaps this is best done programmatically in Cry?
*   Seasons
*   *   360 day cycle - 30 days for each month
*   *   Allow calculations of the current season according to our calendar
*   *   Set an epoch
*   *   Time-slipping will need to be implemented can be an issue in regards to timed story telling e.g. something that needs to happen tomorrow will not happen for 4 day night cycles if we run at 4x real-time speed.
*   Migrations
*   Tides
*   Need to calculate position and rotation / wobble of sun, earth, moon

# The Nexus

The Nexus is the prime meeting point for all major connections within the worlds. The Prime Nexus is the very most central hub which provides access to the major backbones. There will be other nexus worlds that connect off from here, and a very limited amount of space for the early adopters to call their own. Think of the Black Sun and you are there.

# The Prime Nexus

A major city and outlying areas which provides connection to all the major branch worlds. The inner city should bustle with life and provide areas for trade, chat, drinks, meeting, banking, etc. The Nexus worlds run on their own set of the meta rules for the game worlds and are free to implement any features e.g. players can wear any form of clothing, exchange all forms of currency.

Inner city is a tight and functional zone, but with rentable spaces available for people to set up shops, etc. There is some very exclusive housing available here.

Easy access to forms of fast transport will allow people to get from here to their destination worlds in no more than 3 hops, with most worlds accessible within 2 hops.

The Prime Nexus is 4km x 4km, with a bustling hub, and outlying suburbs. There are regions, similar to China Town which are themed to the type of worlds they provide connections to. There should be one of these for each of the major types of setting. There may also be others.

It may be possible to run story lines and quests within this area.

An area this large and crucial to transport might well get very slow and crash prone. Although the central part might be best only visited by high end computers, the outer areas should be accessible to everyone.

Sharding will become necessary at some point, so it will pay to work this into the code as early as possible.

# Setting Specific Nexus

This is a Nexus style zone that is specific to one form of setting e.g. Asian adventures. This should result in a much lower requirement for PC specs, allowing most players to visit these without problems. They will still need to be sharded regardless.

Each should provide a hub area that allows fast movement to both the Prime Nexus and each of the other setting Nexus worlds.

# Major Team Nexus Worlds

While it would be unlikely for a single team to need their own these would provide a handy place for a federation of teams to all work and play.

These would be free areas, bound only by the standard meta rules and a requirement to provide at least the usual handful of Nexus links.

# Outer Worlds

These lie outside the main Nexus points. Think of each as a parcel of land which can hold portals to end-user home worlds. End users would be able to rent (cheap or free) a little portal space and facade within these worlds that allow you to link to any content they may have created. A clickable door in a facade is one way to indicate such places.

Worlds, when spun up should send a keep-alive to a Nexus world to let them know their portal is open and ready to accept guests. A simple indicator would be to switch on a light on your facade and make sure the door is clickable and loaded with the correct address.

# Getting Started

You can start with a very simple world that is just a flat terrain with some white boxes. Attach doors to places, put in some indicator lights. Throw in a rail transport or maybe Routemaster busses.

White box the most important facilities. Consider transport times and game drawing times, etc. Break the place up into zones and stream objects if you can to ensure speed stays high.

Consider ways to prevent everyone walking into the same part of town and all hanging around the damn auction house.

# PAK Files

e.g.

/pak/shattered-screens/cloud-shatter/objects.pak

/pak/shattered-screens/cloud-shatter/quantum-impact/objects.pak

*   Enum all the .PAK files within a folder based on the federation, realm and possibly zone. Load them all into the system for the duration of the level.

# Federation Buy-in

It seems like a decent idea to apply some sort of initial fee to players who want to join a federation. By hitting them for a fee of say $10 up front we have an in-built penalty for players who get banned - they lose that money.

This would help prevent players from creating dozens of accounts from free email services and taking up valuable administration time.

The fee might provide them with in store credit for outfitting their characters, buying some convenience items, or the like e.g. more character slots, extra storage space, clothing.

This fee goes to the federation they join (with a percent to me :D) and represents an admin fee for adding a new char, storage costs, bandwidth and nuisance.

Optionally provide one or more free federations where everything goes e.g. unregulated space. These would potentially be total anarchy with griefing and endless trolling / scams.

Groups could also create their own federations and apply any rules they wish.

The game store would need to support federation only items as well as general ones.

Federations would need to provide a level of management that can potentially override the local realm management, but should not be draconian. They would still need to be able to remove a realm from their federation.

# Organisation

Federation -> Realm -> Zone -> Revision / Shard

*   Federation membership is proven by public / private keys
*   Keys must be revocable easily and should reside in a server configuration area
*   Keys will be issued for each individual zone e.g. ShatteredScreens.CloudShatter.QuantumImpact
*   Federated members should run a DNS service that provides easy easy to all their services e.g. live.quantumimpact.cloudshatter.shattered-screens.com would be the address for a server providing the Quantum Impact live zone.

test.quantumimpact.cloudshatter.shattered-screens.com would do the same for a test version of the realm.

*   Federations can apply trade embargoes and customs to prevent items / money / etc coming into or out of their states.
*   Items might need to have a federationOwnerID, which if not null subjects them to customs regulations
*   Federations could prevent any items that don't have a federationOwnerID from entering their state
*   Each realm should provide at least one zone into which troublesome players / characters can be thrown. If not a zone, at least be able to mark the characters as inactive (not in world) to prevent idiots making 10 characters and blocking off doors with them.

# Content Management

It would be good to be able to apply content management techniques to much of the content of the game. This would be difficult with characters, and would need to work around inventory issues and the like.

One or more separate shards would be ideal for creating / approving / publishing new content.

Content should be able to be batched and released as a new revision / version.

For this to work, characters would need to keep things like location / current health / mantras / chi and the like instanced per shard. Servers would need to be set up to service each shard and write back to shard specific storage. Need to think over whether this can be done using only flags / status or if it will need collections specifically for this. Figure out the pros and cons.

# Spin Up Server

*   Retrieve realm and zone information
*   Query DB for all characters in the zone / realm and load them up and start their scripts.
*   Load resources
*   *   Plants (moss, shrubs, herbs, etc)
*   *   Trees
*   *   Crystals
*   *   Ore / Precious Metals
*   *   Oil
*   Report status to the world server database

# Log In

*   Log in details page
*   Select profile
*   Select realm / zone / character

# Possession

*   Each character can be owned by either an account, a guild, or the realm.
*   Characters will have a permission system to determine who can use them
*   *   Perhaps like a user / group permission (guilds)

# Administration

All realms must have an administration which is run by a charter that all players must agree to.

Above all others are the realm owners and administrators. They have the power to affect any form of change.

At the next level there will be the Triarch, three leaders who are responsible for the realm running, community standards, dealing with player issues and complaints.

The next level is the council. Current thinking is to have one councillor representative from each zone. This will be taken from the guild that controls the most important zone city.

The two minor cities will each be allowed a representative, who is able to vote on certain issues only. Is this way, every major world power will have at least some influence over server events.

Guilds who cannot maintain power of their city will also lose their seat on the council.

The final level are the community managers. These can enact bans on players, settle disputes, etc. They can act as in game GMs. Powers should be moderate, but should not extend to such things as creating / restoring items. Powers might include helping stuck players, investigating issues with player conduct, etc.

# Instance Launcher

A system for launching instances of dungeons and handing out links to them that work.

*   Spin up a few spares for each level so players can enter immediately
*   Level needs to have a routine to reset everything inside it and repopulate
*   Level needs code to reset it after 30 mins (not for raids) if everyone leaves
*   Web service tracks all the currently running servers and hands out the IP / Port for one when requested.
*   First player opens a new level and gets a ticket which is transparently shared with others in his group (if we support groups)
*   Could we just use a group chat instead of a full blown group system? Hand out invites to the chat? I don't want to limit spells and things based on the group but rather on where it is pointed and who it would affect based on range
*   Web service has two interfaces.
*   *   One is used by players to get access to a dungeon. It should be pretty simple.
*   *   The other is for dungeon owners. It will need authentication, ability to add and remove servers, indicate which are in use, hand out tickets for a server, etc.

# Combat

DPS Defence (tank) Support (heal, buff) Control (CC)

Chi flows though the hands, feet, head, heart and solidify at the core.

Holding and releasing chi at the core allows strong defensive techniques.

The hands and feet work together for aggressive action resulting in DPS. You gain 1 meter extra range for every point you spend in these two areas.

The head is controlling. Actions that allow control of others require the head.

The heart is supportive. It allows for supportive actions that help others.

Typical weapons are melee only. If you want ranged attacks you have to use a rifle, pistol, bow, crossbow, wand or staff or other typical ranged weapon. Allow switching between ranged and melee weapons.

*   *   The more points you spent in support, the better your buff e.g. someone with 9 points in support might do a fort for +24, while someone with 5 points only does +18

Build a web / android app that allows people to:

*   create an account
*   create and name characters
*   create their own abilities and name them
*   put together a set of these abilities, chi attunements, and arrange them on action bars. They can name this as their own class / archetype.

Think about 0 chi abilities e.g. karate / kung fu kicks and punches. Basic weapon attacks. A new player will have several hours playing with between zero and three chi points. It must be reasonably fun. The tutorial might hand the first few points out reasonably quickly - as they learn the techniques required to design their archetype and play it.

Combat system could be play tested in small dungeons which are released ahead of the main game development timeline. PVP could be similarly tested.

# Misc

Provide a place they can pose their characters for awesome screenshot / promo of themselves? Make it easy to composite their 3D model in Photoshop or other software by outputting an alpha channel or using a greenscreen?

Staff = rifle holding down attack will have machine gun like effect in their magic school of low power attacks wand = pistol, chi attacks same as pistol staff can use scope / ironsight attacks ... aim staff like a gun at the target ^^

This should level out the physical vs chi based players.

Got to be careful to make sure weapons are not badly balanced re melee vs ranged...same for chi attacks.

# Companions

Limits - need to be sensible - the more companions you have the harder things get and the lower the rewards

Stuff they can do:

*   Harvest resources for you when they spot them
*   Combat (limit to 1/2)
*   Loot (one of the many optional ways to do it...have it spray in the air and companion runs around gathering it and maybe you too.
*   Provide company (it gets lonely sometimes)
*   Leave them somewhere to craft
*   Busy work around your house
*   Send them to base with bags of your loot to vend it, store it, whatever
*   They run a store for you
*   You can swap to use a companion at any time - rapid character switching without logging out and in.
*   As mules, or leading pack mules

# Books, Scrolls, Record Keeping

*   Allow a book to record births, deaths and marriages
*   People exchange their special builds, abilities, scripts, etc as a form of book which they can sell / trade
*   Diaries

# The Promise

*   Introduce characters, define their relationships, motives, goals, characteristics
*   Set the story, location, everyday routine
*   now is the time to make intrinsic character traits known to the audience
*   put in place the blocks that will cause late conflict or resolution
*   set the moral compass
*   the point of no return

# The Turn

*   A change agent comes into frame and turns things around generating conflict
*   relationships are tested, break - alliances change
*   characters struggle to achieve their goals at the cost of other players goals
*   what is right and known is turned upside down

# The Prestige

*   conflicts are resolved
*   alliances may switch and settle on new teams or with old partners
*   threads are trimmed
*   the moral is laid bare
*   you reap what you sow

# Qi Training

If we implement levels of chi power (say 0-11) we might also like to make it so only a higher level character can train you in that qi skill.

e.g. Socks might be considered lvl 12, and thus could train anyone up to and including lvl 11\. She would do the initial training in the game for other characters and these might later spread out around the map. Seeking out a master to train you could become a more integral part of the game than simply hearthing and running to your trainer.

Training should involve some time or cut scenes of activities that would improve your skill e.g. quiet meditation around a lake with a meditation master, waterfall training, beach training, climbing, combat which you need to win to gain the next level, etc.

There will be at least one system character for each of the skills needed, for each race. We can pace limit everyone if desired by making these masters also seek out training from their masters, and improve over time.

For example: the beginner zone trainers might just be level 3 at the start, but over time the are raised all the way to level 11\. This forms an artificial cap, so be careful with it.

# Google Apps

At the least there should be

*   character server
*   item server (creation, trade)

Each federation member can store whatever item data they like for a character. Movement of items will be covered by trade rules, customs, embargoes and the like between the federations.

## Layout

*   Shattered Screens Applications
*   *   com.shatteredscreens.characters
*   *   com.shatteredscreens.lootmaster (creates loot for mobs)
*   Cloud Shatter (a federation member)
*   *   com.cloudshatter.items (bank, mail, overflow, within the world, etc)
*   *   com.cloudshatter.scripts (many characters can share a script - but writable only by it's owner)
*   *   com.cloudshatter.items

# Handling Race

Since each federation will potentially want their own races and these might have conflicting requirements we will need to use a fully qualified race name system. At the minimum we will provide a human race.

e.g. (federation.race) shatteredscreens.human cloudshatter.frika cloudshatter.bawkbawk

If you wish to support play with races from other federations you will need to download their PAK files which contain all the models, animations, materials, textures, etc. It might be a good idea to pack these separate to all the other content e.g.

CloudShatterRaces-1.0.0.PAK CloudShatterItems-1.0.0.PAK

Spell effects and the like will need to be universal most likely, but if not, they and other things like them should follow this principle.

A further option, would involve just packing the subset of items that are allowed to be exported from your federation into these PAK files e.g.

CloudShatterRacesExport-1.0.0.PAK CloudShatterItemsExport-1.0.0.PAK

Following this method, teams might want to separate out all the export items from the non-export in their folder of assets e.g.

textures/team/cloudshatter/local textures/team/cloudshatter/export

You can skip all this if you are happy to just export everything or operate a closed border.

# Immigration / Customs

This will need to be enforced whenever a character moves across either a realm boundary or a federation boundary. Each boundary owner is entitled to set their immigration and customs policy for both ingress and egress.

For characters, this will mean that they can't travel to federations and realms which don't support their race. Their banks are local to their federation / realm. Items they are wearing or carrying are able to cross borders as long as they all meet the regulations for both. Anything you are carrying which is not able to be moved across can perhaps be kept in a storage locker at the train station / airport / whatever (automatically moved from your person / inventory to this long term storage). They can be collected again as you re-enter.

All federations / realms should be able to provide a set of 'starter' clothing, weapons, items for characters coming through as a courtesy. This will be particularly needed for ones with 'closed' borders, meaning no items or currency can cross over.

An inter-galactic banking consortium might be able to arrange transfers of large sums of currency to other realms / federations for the usual fees (subject to ingress / outgress laws).

The idea is to allow a person to wander freely on their character through all the realms of all the federations (human are the only ones guaranteed this right), carrying some possessions if possible. There can be nexus places where all sorts of races with all sorts of insane gear can gather and show off if that is their thing :D

The tank diving idea is a fine way to tie it all together. In the case of Cloud Shatter, it is a dream within a dream... The tank place can be a Nexus world and should be built early on.

# Loot

All loot drops are handled using a SessionKey which identifies the realm for which it is valid. Loot will go into storage tied to that realm. In order to move the loot to any other realm the player will need to visit an instance run by the Universal Trade Organisation.

This allows indies and independents to create their world in isolation, populate it as they see fit and allow visitors who can gain and retain rewards from playing in their world.

In order for items to be available in all worlds they will need to be submitted for approval, cataloguing, and will require an ID that is universally valid. This might be more work that it's worth for most items.

# Universal Trade Organisation

This is the highly trusted organisation that handles moving items and currency from one realm to another. It is controlled by strict rules and is staffed by only the most trusted players. It will need to take into account exchange rates and the appropriateness of loot items in various realms - including model and texture availability.

Any zone can have one or more portals which lead to a UTO trade port. These trade ports can optionally be decorated in a way that is suitable to the realm.

The UTO will have a large amount of power in the form of semi-dangerous REST calls and these will need to be logged and monitored.

# Skills

Wide and shallow. It should be possible to reach the maximum ability level with any given skill branch in a reasonable period of time. Players should be able to be 50% effective as DPS or a healer within just a few short hours of play. Don't make people invest 10 days played time just to be able to start having to gear up to become effective enough to join their friends in the game.

There must be a balance here between giving them everything really early and then leaving them with nothing to strive towards, and making them slave away for months just to max out a stat.

Ideally, I want to be able to play using just the major keys on my G13, and keyboard players (and possibly controller players) should have a good experience without needing to map 40+ keys. Initial thoughts are that main combat should be handled with the 9 keys under and above my fingers (not pinkies). Dodge, block, specials and ultimates can fall outside this but must be on easily utilised keys.

Each character will be given a budget of skill points they can spend e.g. new players have 50, enough to map out one or two skills; older players might have 1,000 or more. The amount of points need to be granular enough to allow fine tuned control over mapped skills.

possible

Skill # Type Adjustments Points 1 Weapon Opener Weapon + Opener + mild debuff 120 2 Weapon Finisher Weapon + Finisher (200% bonus below x) 140 3 Weapon AOE 100 4 Weapon Weapon + resource regen 80 5 Weapon 80 6 Buff 7 Debuff 8 Heal Modest self heal 9 CC Ultimate
Special
/ (Class defining)

The skills and weapons might be different for each of the stances (offensive, defensive, supportive). Each stance might impose limits on the number of each type of skill and a points budget for each. e.g. offensive might be 4+ weapon skills (600), 1 cc (160 max), 1 self heal (160 max), 1 buff (160 max) / debuff (160 max).

Each weapon will require training with a skill line to master and it will unlock more skill point allocations for that weapon as well as higher limits on customisations for the skill e.g. a new player can only use a straight up DPS attack, a mid level can add a debuff and a DoT, while a master can do all that and even apply a stun or other major combat multiplier abilities to it (given enough budget).

Everyone can dodge, block and stealth to a reasonable degree. Skill lines and their skills will provide those who wish for it with improved abilities.

Include charged attacks aka ESO style. Skills can provide benefits based on these "white hits".

# Rule of Thirds

When in the stance which is natural to the skill being used it will operate at full strength and gain advantage of any passives and bonuses due. Equipping the same skill into any other stance will result in it working at 2/3 of full strength and bonuses and passives no longer apply. This gives you access to skills, albeit at a downgraded level.

e.g. using a CC from the aggressive stance will mean it only applies for 2/3 of the rated time and any bonuses to it's duration will be negated. A 6 second snare with 2 seconds passive bonus becomes a 4 second snare in the incorrect stance.

Some skills might be rated to work in several stances.

# Raid Difficulty

*   Modestly easy to enter and start after you have completed heroic level content.
*   Stepped levels of difficulty - like the Sartharian fight in WoW with three drakes up compared to only two drakes
*   *   e.g. a frost drake, an acid drake, an electricity drake - and Sarth with fire - making resistances harder to gear against

Imagine how cool a raid could be with 72 people, made up of 3 groups of 24 players on one side - and GM / respected players controlling a few uber strong boss mobs and swarms of zergs - like RTS vs RPG! Each side battling to wipe the other side and take the 'match' and thus the rewards.

# Self Esteem

Bitch roles. Typically, some roles are considered less prestigious than others, less glamorous. They are given to the players with the lowest DPS (support roles) or least gear (off tanks). We need to make these roles feel every bit as important as the main tank, top DPS and lead healers.

One way might be to provide metrics for how well this job is done. This is clearly harder to define that a simple count of damage healed / dealt / mitigated. Thoughts:

*   secondary objectives in boss fights that throw up achievements and award loot at the end of the fight
*   make the fights less about single bosses and focused damage and move more towards PVP style battles
*   have more battles with a council instead of one boss
*   secondary objectives must be harder than clicking a button
*   examples might include needing two or more sub-parties who work completely independent of the main group, in different rooms even
*   difficulty of main fight is scaled based on success of side teams
*   buffer roles / support roles must contribute something significant, vital
*   special rewards for a support role
*   support roles need to be high skill jobs e.g. a healer in AoC meant getting in close, covering people with cone heals, knowing when to snap out the snap heal. Support needs to be able to take on tasks every bit as complex as the main fight.

# Gods

Characters can believe in Gods, make sacrifices, pray, etc to give them power.

*   Gods may delegate heros and give them power too.
*   People should build altars to the Gods.

# Misc

Make sure you build a comprehensive modding / addon system.

# Finesse System

Steal from ESO. Finesse XP for dodging, blocking, not standing in fire, using synergies and skills at right time (e.g. a finisher at 30% or lower, openers to open).

*   extra loot
*   extra XP
*   other bonuses for not sucking

# Dungeons

For pay to enter dungeons, provide an achievement system that would allow good players to get a refund upon completing the dungeon. This would cover things such as:

*   complete without dying once
*   complete without anyone in the group dying
*   speed runs
*   extra objective completion

This provides an incentive for better geared players to take friends through, since they might be able to get a substantial discount on the cost of the run.

Possibly, after a set number of achievements, allow them to go as a tour guide, for free. This will need daily / hourly limitations.

# Resource Regeneration

*   Scales with the amount of points placed into that resource. Regen / sec ranging from say 1% - 10% / sec depending on the amount of points you allocated.
*   Regen is based on the amount of points you currently have remaining e.g. you have 10/100 then regen is much lower than for when you have 90/100\. This should dissuade people from spamming out all their resources at the start of a fight.

# Gun for Hire

Players could hire out use of their characters for either an episode or a time period.

I expect people would want to level up characters for others to play. By partially supporting this market we can weaken any third party markets that would exploit the players.

# Partial Story Mode

A partial story is one where many of the larger events are known in advance, but the characters have the ability to approach it in different ways which may affect the rest of the story.

Everyone begins as a spectator to an event. The event introduces some plot and the main characters. Lesser characters are also present. Players may choose to possess any one of these characters for the duration of the story.

Each character is already outfitted with gear, and has some or all of their ability points pre-spent and unable to be changed. Additionally, they may have access to resources that will push or pull the adventure in different directions. For example, there may be characters who

*   are fighters, healers, ranged damage dealers, etc
*   acrobats, climbers or lock pickers who can open up different play paths
*   own a vehicle that can transport several players
*   has a sub-plot involving a side trip to gain treasure or otherwise
*   has a sub-plot that causes them to betray the group
*   has weaknesses, but also some strengths
*   can reveal details about themselves, back-story, things that add interest to a story
*   assassination of player character by another as a forced story option...or...give that player two or more options, which might include assassination, triggering a sub-plot, foiled assassination, or any of thousands of plot twists

Characters who die during the adventure may stay dead. Those players will need to join again as a character who can be introduced at a later point. It would be useful to be able to spawn a few of these shortly after the deaths. Dead players can either hit the lobby for a bit or follow the story as a spectator.

Other players can optionally tag along as spectators - need a good spectator cam for this. Hopefully I can access the ones already built in the game.

Rewards for this type of play would need to be account bound since the characters do not belong to the player. One reward type might be useful for opening up new sections or paths later e.g. a token that allows access to a new area for people who have succeeded at least once before. Perhaps an area where if you have three people with the token you open up a whole bonus area with good rewards, but can take another pass if you don't have it.

The idea for this is a short adventure, 1-3 hours of play, but wide. There should be many different ways to get from the start through to one of several ends. In some part this could be random, and somewhat by the selection of the characters at the start.

Game writes a journal of the adventure in story format. This would need templating for much of it. Dialogue spoken by the players could be recorded into the journal. They get a book with their story in it as part of the reward for playing.

Ability to hand out faction for your guild / self in measured doses to other players to enable you to track good players you wish to play with.

e.g. running PUG raids, give faction at the end to everyone who helped - this gives you a quick way to find players next time or to vet a newer player looking to join. It needs limits on it to prevent abuse, and so rewards might need to trigger on events like a boss death or puzzle solution being found.

Maybe track it entirely separate to the faction from mission completion for your faction.

# Kamma

[http://www.suanmokkh.org/archive/arts/message/kamma1.htm](http://www.suanmokkh.org/archive/arts/message/kamma1.htm)

Kamma is the little understood and often misrepresented principle laid out by the Buddha. Most people's understanding of kamma is that it their actions bring about good / evil results and this accumulates like some sort of scoring system until death. They believe that after death your kamma determines the sort of rebirth you will attain in a future life.

This is not the Buddha's teaching of kamma.

In the Buddha's teaching kamma arises from both action and the intent of the action. He defines three types of kamma.

*   That which is helpful
*   That which is harmful
*   That which removes kamma

There should be a system within the game to represent kamma based on the intent and action of the actor, and their results. This should include indications of key components of the kamma e.g.

*   Positive / Negative
*   *   Perhaps this can be broken down in categories like
*   *   *   harm
*   *   *   pain
*   *   *   anguish
*   *   *   terror
*   *   *   loss of property
*   *   *   loss of xxx
*   *   *   relief of suffering
*   *   *   *   provision of food / water
*   *   *   *   protection from elements
*   *   *   *   protection from persecution
*   *   *   removal of confusion / superstition / wrong teachings
*   Strength of the effect (0-10 or -10 to +10 with 0 being no kamma arising)
*   Actors
*   Duration of effect

Kamma duration should be measured in whole units e.g.

*   minute
*   hour
*   day
*   month
*   year
*   lifetime

While these are not even distributions, they are useful and intuitive ways to measure how long a person might suffer from their kamma. An example might be taking an action that causes someone to break their leg. The kamma from that might be regarded as strong negative kamma for a period of 2 months - a typical healing period. It might decay over that time period, so it is stronger at first, and lessened as the recipient of the pain and inconvenience lessened. Killing someone would induce a kamma of the strongest form that lasts for your entire life.

Thought: Does relieving another's kamma (or even your own) that has been caused by a third party acrue good kamma to the actor?

# Kamma Charting

I like the idea of being able to place all the important information about a player on a chart of their kamma. Quests within the game should look at how they interact with the principles of kamma and the results of the chart. At any time a player could view a representation of their instantaneous kamma on this chart.

Example:

A player is given a mission to perform. As they take the mission we ask questions which determine what their intention is by doing this deed. We perhaps give them one or more paths in which the mission can be achieved, one peaceful, one warlike, another through theft / cunning or even honesty. When they undertake the actions for the mission kamma will arise, and knowing both the action and the intent, and having determined the outcome we can record the kamma for them and report it. This provides a tool which will help them recognise kamma arising in their own lives.

Another example is to determine what their current desires are for worldly things, and plot this on a chart. We would need a way to find out what they desire e.g. a new weapon, power over others, a plot of land and then determine how much they wanted it and plot it on a chart of future desires.

For example:

The chart shows the x axis as a period of future time. The y axis indicates how strongly you desire a thing and how imperative it is for you to have it over this time period. Break the period down as for kamma:

*   minute
*   hour
*   day
*   month
*   year
*   lifetime

Points on the chart represent the desire, the strength of it, and a point in time.

## Charting How the Past Affects Us

Using an x axis of time and a y axis indicating both positive / negative and strength we can plot negative emotions / memories and thus suffering. The death of a friend would be a strong negative point on this chart, or perhaps shown as a line that is born and dies (spontaneously) as the actions first occur, and then over time you find a way to remove this kamma. Funerals, placing flowers on graves, prayers and the like might all be ways to reduce this kamma for the actor.

### Mission Chart

A mission chart might show all of the current missions you are undertaking, and plot them out as a chart (instantaneous) of the kamma you are experiencing. How this is to be done needs some thought, but at the least the goals of the mission should appear, along with recent actions undertaken. Missions should remain on the chart until such time as they decay or the kamma can be removed.

## Shard Master

Go program to launch instances and manage their lifetime.

*   Config file to handle config including
*   *   Port to listen on
*   *   Port range to open servers on
*   *   Maps to load
*   *   Number of instances
*   *   Number of hot instances

Use REST API for communications. Provide verbs to start and stop servers as well as reset their contents. Consider putting health and performance monitoring in here - though it might be easiest to place it inside the actual server on another thread.

On startup of each instance make a random 64 bit key for them (serverid, timestamp, random) and pass it to them as base64\. Get them to pass it back when communicating with you so you know who is who. Should only be needed for initial backwards connection.

## Combat Skills That Interact With Each Other

Think of ways to extend the combat skills so they have synergy with other skills for the player and their team-mates e.g. firing arrows over a fire AOE in GW2 makes the arrow catch fire.

*   Launching a slow moving ball or set of balls that can be exploded by another attack
*   Combo chains for an attack e.g. first use does PBAOE damage, second use provides you a small heal, third use ignites a DoT

# Events

Events can be scheduled by the player community or the GMs. It will require an excellent calendar system, with public access, access control, editing, notifications, etc.

The idea is to allow the community to create their own events and make these known to the other players. Integration with real world systems should be considered e.g. Facebook groups, Twitter, etc to help make the events known.

There should be an easy way to blog the events, including screenshots, write ups, publishing details of it to the forums afterwards.

Events can make entries into the "world diary"...as kind of journal of all the cool stuff that has happened on the server.
